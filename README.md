# TfL Pi - Transport for London E-Paper Display

A Python project that displays real-time Transport for London (TfL) tube and bus departure information on an e-paper display, powered by a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W.

## Overview

This project transforms a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W and Waveshare 7.5-inch e-paper display into a low-power departure board for London's public transport network. Perfect for keeping track of local tube and bus times at a glance.

## Hardware Requirements

- **Raspberry Pi Zero 2W**
- **Waveshare 7.5-inch e-Paper HAT**
    - Resolution: 800×480 pixels
    - Interface: SPI
    - Display color: Black/White
- microSD card
- Power supply for Raspberry Pi

## Features

- Real-time tube departure information
- Real-time bus departure information
- Low power consumption thanks to e-paper display
- Automatic refresh intervals
- Clean, readable interface optimized for e-paper
- Uses official TfL API

## Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi OS (Raspbian) installed on your Pi Zero 2W
- Python 3.7 or higher
- TfL API key (free registration at [TfL API Portal](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/))
- Internet connection for fetching live data

## Installation

### Quick Setup (Recommended)

The easiest way to set up the project is using the automated setup script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/taiyrbegeyev/tfl-pi.git
cd tfl-pi
./setup.sh
```

This will:

- Install system dependencies
- Create a Python virtual environment
- Install all Python packages
- Download the Waveshare e-paper driver
- Enable SPI interface
- Create your config.json

## Configuration

1. Copy the example configuration file:

```bash
cp config.example.json config.json
```

2. Edit `config.json` with your settings:

```json
{
  "tfl_api_key": "YOUR_TFL_API_KEY",
  "stop_points": {
    "tube": [
      "STATION_ID"
    ],
    "bus": [
      "STOP_ID"
    ]
  },
  "refresh_interval": 60,
  "display_settings": {
    "width": 800,
    "height": 480
  }
}
```

### Finding Stop Point IDs

You can find stop point IDs using the TfL API:

- **Tube stations**: Use the [StopPoint API](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/StopPoint/Search/)
- **Bus stops**: Check bus stop signs for the 5-digit code or use TfL's journey planner

## Usage

### Run Once

First, activate the virtual environment, then run the application:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python3 main.py
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the application.

### Run as a Service

To have the display update automatically on boot:

```bash
sudo cp tfl-display.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl enable tfl-display.service
sudo systemctl start tfl-display.service
```

**Note:** The `tfl-display.service` file is automatically generated by `setup.sh` with your username and installation directory. If you moved the project or
changed users, re-run `./setup.sh` to regenerate it with correct paths.

The systemd service automatically uses the virtual environment, so no need to activate it manually.

Check status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status tfl-display.service
```

View logs:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u tfl-display.service -f
```

## TfL API

This project uses the [TfL Unified API](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/). You'll need to register for a free API key:

1. Visit [TfL API Portal](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/)
2. Register for an account
3. Generate an API key
4. Add the key to your `config.json`

### API Rate Limits

- Free tier: 500 requests per minute
- This project is designed to stay well within these limits

## Log Management

The application only logs warnings and errors to prevent filling up storage. Logs are managed by systemd's journal which has automatic rotation and retention
policies.

### View Logs

```bash
# View recent logs
sudo journalctl -u tfl-display.service -n 50

# Follow logs in real-time
sudo journalctl -u tfl-display.service -f

# View logs from today
sudo journalctl -u tfl-display.service --since today
```
